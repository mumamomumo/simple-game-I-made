## Weird game!!!
A game I made for my mom because she needed a game to host for people.

I used this project to learn the basics of connecting devices with databases. I also used this project to learn the basic of SolidJS. 

I used supabase to connect devices, and SolidJS for the frontend.


Also, for the database table name and column name, the only place you should have to change them is the `GameData.ts` file. That's the file that connects the app to the database. If there is somewhere else where I referenced the database, then... shit
